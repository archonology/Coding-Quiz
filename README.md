# Code Quiz Challenge
by Reed Meher, U of MN Coding Bootcamp, 2022.

## Project Summary

We were tasked this week with creating a quiz using Javascript. Below I will describe the function of my coding quiz project.  

Shout out to all the coders who came before and the wonderful staff at the U of MN coding Bootcamp! This challenge was especially difficult for me: the art of creating and stacking functions has really alluded me up until the last few days before this assigment was due.  After 20+ hours or building, deleting, and rebuilding my function stack and my objects, and almost as many hours researching, I finally found some examples of function stacks that brought it all home (I mean, more home -- I got a long way to go!), and I was able to write a whole new script in a relatively short time. Better still, it had functionality!

I was able to pull a lot of the functions and objects from previous efforts to and blend them with my new script.  Then a day of styling with CSS, and here we are! It's not perfect, but I am proud of what I was able to achieve.  

## Site functionality

- this is a timed quiz that begins when you click on the "start quiz" text.

- When you click start, the timer in the top left corner activates and the first question displays. 

- when you click an option, the next question will appear in place of the previous. You will also see a message that says if you got the last question right or not. If you get it wrong, there is a 3 second time penality subtracted from the counter.

- If the timer reaches zero before you finish answering the 7 questions, the page is reset to the start screen.

- if you complete the quiz within the time limit, your score will be displayed -- in questions answered correctly and your percent. 

- you will be prompted to enter your initials and score with a save button that follows. Your score will pop up on the screen with your initials upon saving, and if you refresh the page and click on the "View High Scores" header text, the last score and initials will be displayed. 

- Complete!

## Special Thanks

special thanks to "CodeExpolainedRepo" on Github and Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeExplained).  Their script tutorials were especially helpful to my learning style and brought home a bunch of basic things that just weren't clicking for me. For example, I was nesting all my functions within one greater function, rather than stacking a number of smaller functions that all interlock through calling eachother, or executing in the stack order. I learned that functions are less like Troika dolls and more like threads on a spiderweb... and it blew my mind. :)

Cheers!
