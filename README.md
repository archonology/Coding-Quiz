## Project Summary

We were tasked this week with creating a dynamic, timed coding quiz with a special focus on building and practicing Javascript skills. The site needed to be well styled with a polished look.

## Site functionality

- this is a timed quiz that begins when you click on the "start quiz" text.

- When you click start, the timer activates and the first question displays. 

- when you click an option, the next question will appear in place of the previous. You will also see a message that says if you got the last question right or not. If you get it wrong, there is a 3 second time penality subtracted from the counter.

- When the timer gets to 10 seconds, it changes to include a warning message --If the timer reaches zero before you finish answering the 7 questions, the page will refresh. 

- if you complete the quiz within the time limit, your score will be displayed.

- you will be prompted to enter your initials with a save button that follows. Your score will be auto saved. If you refresh the page and click on the "View High Scores" header text, the last score and user initials will be displayed. 
- a "try again?" button appears upon saving your score. This button triggers the page to be refreshed.
